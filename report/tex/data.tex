\subsection{Image Generation}
To generate the images the \texttt{flickr\_30k} dataset is used. To begin with the images are resized to $64 \times 64$ in order to make the training process faster. Training a GAN is a very time-consuming process. Most images are in a 4:3 format so the motifs aren't distorted too much. Cropping would risk removing important elements of the scene in the image.
