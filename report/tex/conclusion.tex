This has been a massive project and we aimed far too high. In hindsight, we should have chosen one of the three parts and put our full focus on that. Even if the results are worse than expected we still feel like we have learnt a lot because we implemented the majority of the networks from scratch. Future expansions would be to make the text embedding context aware and increase the quality of the output images as was done in \cite{zhang2017stackgan}. Future implementations could be creating videos from a music track in order to create a new kind of music aware screensaver instead of the typical Windows Media Player one.
