# Datasets

* Conceptual Captions [link](https://ai.google.com/research/ConceptualCaptions/download)

* Flickr 30k [link](https://www.kaggle.com/hsankesara/flickr-image-dataset/version/1)

* TIMIT Speech corpus [link](https://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC93S1)

I think that we should use the flickr dataset as the 30k images should really be enough in the limited time we have.

Once you have downloaded the flickr dataset extract it and run the resize script
that's located in the flickr30k_images folder, from the folder in question
```bash
bash resize_images.sh
```
